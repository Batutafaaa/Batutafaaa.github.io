Welcome to my website! 

I am a first year PhD student in Economics at

in Mumbai, India. I am broadly interested in **financial inclusion**, **econometric methods** and **economics of discrimination**. 

I completed my Masters in Economics from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.unisi.it/departments/department-economics-and-statistics">University of Siena</a>, Italy, and my Bachelor's degree from <a target="_blank" href="https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/programmes/ba-in-economics"> Azim Premji University</a>, India.
